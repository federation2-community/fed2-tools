-- Startup topology sync
--
-- Once per login, re-ground the jump model (cartel->syndicate groupings and
-- syndicate beacon builds) with a single "display cartels" / "display
-- syndicates" pass, so speedwalk jump planning is correct from the first
-- jump even though galaxy politics drift between sessions.
--
-- Runs in every startup mode, including Minimal: it's a plain GMCP handler
-- that only sends game commands (swallowed by capture triggers, opts.silent),
-- needing no map pane or mapper widget.
--
-- Gated to fire once per connection, keyed off gmcp.char.vitals with a flag
-- that re-arms on disconnect. The sync is deferred a few seconds so its
-- commands never land mid-login.
