# fed2-tools

A Mudlet package for [Federation 2 Community Edition](https://federation2.com) that provides mapping, navigation, automated trading, factory management, and quality-of-life improvements.

## Features

| Component | Commands | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Map | `nav`, `map` | Auto-mapping builds the map as you explore. Speedwalk navigation gets you anywhere fast. Exploration mode automatically visits unmapped rooms. |
| Hauling | `haul` | Automated trading that adapts to your rank. Commanders/Captains run Armstrong Cuthbert jobs, Adventurers do Akaturi deliveries, Merchants+ trade between exchanges. |
| Factory | `factory` | View status of all your factories in one table. Flush all production to market with a single command. |
| Planet Owner | `po` | View your planet's economy at a glance — commodity values, production, consumption, stock levels, and efficiency. Filter by commodity group. |
| Commodities | `price`, `bb`, `bs` | Check commodity prices across all cartel exchanges. Find the best places to buy and sell, with profit calculations. Buy or sell commodities in bulk at exchanges. |
| Auto-Refuel | `f2t settings` | Automatically refuels your ship when landing at shuttlepads. Triggers when fuel drops below your configured threshold. |
| Stamina Monitor | `f2t settings` | Detects low stamina and navigates to buy food. Pauses active automation, refills stamina, then returns you to where you were. |
| Death Monitor | `f2t settings` | Handles death automatically by stopping all automation and running `insure`. Permanently locks the death room so navigation avoids it. |
| UI | `ui` | Replaces the default Mudlet layout with a purpose-built interface: resizable frames, tabbed output windows, an embedded map, and rank-aware tabs for hauling and trading. |

## Installation

### 1. Download and install Mudlet

Get Mudlet from [mudlet.org](https://www.mudlet.org/) and install it.

### 2. Create a profile and connect to Federation 2

Launch Mudlet, create a new profile for Federation 2, and connect.

### 3. Install fed2-tools from the Package Manager

1. Open **Toolbox → Package Manager** (or press **Alt+O**)
2. Click the **Available** tab
3. Search for **fed2-tools**
4. Click the **fed2-tools** result, then click **Install**

> **Note:** If you have any existing mapper packages installed, uninstall them first — multiple mappers conflict. fed2-tools removes `generic_mapper` automatically, but other mapping packages need to be removed manually via **Package Manager → Uninstall**.

### Alternative: Install from GitHub Releases

Download the latest `fed2-tools.mpackage` from the [Releases](../../releases) page, then go to **Package Manager → Install from file** and select the downloaded file.

## Initial Setup

After installing, follow these steps to get the most out of fed2-tools.

### 1. Import a Base Map

The package comes with bundled with two starter maps to help you get started. Additionally, a third map including shuttlepads and exchanges for all planets in the galaxy is available in this repository.

|Map|Description|
|--|--|
|starter_map.json|Matches the maps available in the [Federation 2 Guide](https://federation2.com/guide/#sec-20).|
|starter_map_with_exchanges.json|Adds exchanges for planets where they were not included in the starter map.|
|galaxy_brief.json|Available in the maps folder of this repository, includes all systems, planets, and their shuttlepads and exchanges as of the commit date.|

To import:

```
map import
```

Select the map JSON file you wish to import, then confirm with:

```
map confirm
```

The bundled maps are included as resources in the package (and are also in the maps folder in this repo). You can find them at:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Mudlet\profiles\<profile>\fed2-tools\shared\resources`
- **macOS**: `~/.config/mudlet/profiles/<profile>/fed2-tools/shared/resources`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/mudlet/profiles/<profile>/fed2-tools/shared/resources`

Alternatively, skip this step and explore on your own - the mapper auto-creates rooms as you move with `map on` enabled.

### 2. Enable Automatic Refueling

Never run out of fuel again. When enabled, your ship automatically refuels at shuttlepads when fuel drops below the threshold.

```
f2t settings set refuel_threshold 50
```

This sets the threshold to 50% - your ship will refuel whenever fuel is at or below 50%. Adjust the number to your preference (1-100). Set to 0 to disable.

To check current settings: `f2t settings`

### 3. Enable Stamina Monitoring

Automatically handles low stamina by navigating to buy food, then returning you to what you were doing.

```
f2t settings set stamina_threshold 25
f2t settings set food_source Sol.Earth.454
```

This triggers a food run when stamina drops to 25%. Change `food_source` to your preferred food location.

### 4. Enable Death Monitoring

When enabled, the system automatically handles death by:
- Stopping all automation (hauling, exploration, navigation)
- Running `insure` after respawn
- Locking the room where death occurred so navigation avoids it in the future

To enable:

```
f2t settings set death_monitor_enabled true
```

### 5. Enable the UI (Enabled by default)

The UI component replaces the default Mudlet console with a purpose-built interface for Federation 2. It provides resizable frames, an embedded map, and tabbed windows. Tabs are user-configurable — examples include General, Exchange, Chat, Cargo, Hauling, and Who. There are also overall status readouts, local players listing, a galaxy navigator, and a UI that lists all fed2-tools settings. Some elements are shown or hidden automatically based on your rank, so the UI will become more feature-rich as you progress.

> **Tip:** Many UI elements assume a well-populated map database. Importing `galaxy_brief.json` (see step 1 above) is recommended for the best experience.

```
ui on     # Enable the UI
ui off    # Disable the UI and restore the default Mudlet
```

## Quick Reference

### Navigation

Get anywhere fast with the `nav` command (aliases: `go`, `goto`):

```
nav Earth              # Go to Earth (shuttlepad by default)
nav Earth orbit        # Go to Earth orbit
nav Sol                # Go to Sol system link room
nav exchange           # Go to exchange in current area
nav Earth exchange     # Go to Earth's exchange
nav mybase             # Go to saved destination "mybase"
```

**Room identifiers:** Fed2 uses hashes like `Sol.Earth.454` (system.area.room_number) to identify rooms. Mudlet uses numeric room IDs internally. You can use either format with `nav`, and Fed2 hashes work in settings like `food_source` and `safe_room`.

Save your favorite locations:

```
map dest add mybase    # Save current location as "mybase"
map dest               # List all saved destinations
map dest remove mybase # Remove saved destination
```

Control speedwalk:

```
nav stop               # Stop navigation
nav pause              # Pause navigation
nav resume             # Resume navigation
```

### Mapping

Auto-mapping is enabled by default. As you move, rooms and exits are created automatically.

```
map on                 # Enable auto-mapping
map off                # Disable auto-mapping
```

Explore new areas automatically:

```
map explore            # Auto-explore current area
map explore Earth      # Auto-explore Earth
map explore Sol        # Auto-explore Sol system
map explore galaxy     # Auto-explore everything (takes a while!)
map explore stop       # Stop exploration
```

Search the map:

```
map search casino      # Search current area
map search Earth casino # Search specific planet
map search all casino  # Search entire map
```

### Trading

Check commodity prices:

```
price alloys           # Show best buy/sell locations for alloys
price all              # Analyze all commodities (30-40 seconds)
```

**Note:** Price checking requires the Remote Price Check Service. See the [Fed2 guide](https://federation2.com/guide/#sec-230.20) for details on acquiring it.

Bulk buy and sell at exchanges:

```
bb alloys              # Buy alloys until hold is full
bb alloys 5            # Buy 5 lots of alloys
bs                     # Sell all cargo
bs alloys              # Sell all alloys
bs alloys 3            # Sell 3 lots of alloys
```

### Automated Hauling

Start automated trading appropriate for your rank:

```
haul start             # Begin hauling
haul stop              # Stop gracefully
haul status            # Check current status
haul pause             # Pause operation
haul resume            # Resume operation
```

The system automatically adapts:
- **Commander/Captain**: Armstrong Cuthbert courier jobs
- **Adventurer**: Akaturi delivery contracts
- **Merchant+**: Exchange-to-exchange commodity trading

### Factory Status (Industrialist/Manufacturer)

View all your factories in one table:

```
factory status         # or: fac status
```

Send all production to market:

```
factory flush          # or: fac flush
```

### Planet Owner (Founder+)

View your planet's economy:

```
po economy             # Economy for current planet
po economy Earth       # Economy for specific planet
po economy agri        # Filter by commodity group
po econ Earth tech     # Planet + group filter
```

**Groups:** agricultural (agri), resource, industrial (ind), technological (tech), biological, leisure

### System Commands

```
f2t status             # Show all component states
f2t settings           # View all settings
f2t debug on           # Enable debug logging
f2t debug off          # Disable debug logging

## Settings

All components use a consistent settings interface:

```
<component> settings                    # List all settings
<component> settings get <n>         # Get specific setting
<component> settings set <n> <value> # Set a setting
<component> settings clear <n>       # Reset to default
```

### Common Settings

Settings are organized by component. Use `<component> settings` to see all settings for a component.
